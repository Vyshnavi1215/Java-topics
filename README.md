**Servlets**

- What is Servlets?

- Servet means Server component.

- Whenever we have any any word that ends with let like servlet, applet, facelet, it means a component.
- So servlet is server component, applet means application component.

- Now what is servlet??

- Think of the situation where the request comes from the client which asks for some information like adding a number , this is quite simple and the response will be sent easily, but when we get the request as to load any profile page say for an example an user requests for his facebook/instagram profile, now the page should be created dynamically.

- In order to create dynamic pages we use Servlet, the information will be fecthed from dtatbase and the response will be sent accoring to the request.

- Now here the static page means that will be already built in server side, but dynamic pages are built upon client request at run time.
